        So Wonder Woman and Quinn set out into the night to one of the favorite
        spots 'Dungeon Misbehave' a place where all sorts of fun folk like to
        stop by and play. She felt a little bad for ditching her crew so she
        decided to restrict her fun to the space of the dungeon for tonight.

        />
        <p>
          Quinn had let all of their all of their old pleasure pals know that
          Diana was coming back home to play so when Wonder Woman walked into
          Dungeon Misbehave after almost two years away it was to a shower of
          cheers and applause. She couldn't count on her fingers and toes all
          the men she had tied up with her lasso of truth in that place.

        />
        <p>
          While fraternizing with the other patrons of the establishment a
          handsome gentleman by the name of Thor decided to pop in and request a
          bit of playtime with the queen of the Amazons. Diana was happy to
          oblige. She had met Thor on other occasions and he was always so
          formal it was a nice surprise to see him out of his usual character.
          Unfortunately by Diana's standards Thor was weak sauce all lightning
          and no sting. Quinn would've made him cry like a girl.

      <p>
        After a wonderful night of partying with Quinn and other old friends
        Wonder Woman went back to the life that she knew so well and had grown
        so accustomed with a bad case of amnesia.
