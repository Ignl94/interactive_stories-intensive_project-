        They spent the next hour and a half reminiscing about old times, they
        ordered more food and decided to sit by the fireplace to enjoy their
        drinks. Harley told Diana stories about how her pudding would beat
        Monsieur Mallah at cards and how he would get mad and fling poo at him.
        She also told her how Poison Ivy was always getting high off of her
        herbs then coming over in the middle of the night to come sleep in her
        bed and watch movies.

        This amused Wonder Woman greatly, it had been a while since she had
        given the Joker a good thrashing and she knew he kinda liked it. She
        also knew that Batman was totally obsessed with him. He had his posters
        all over his office walls in Justice League headquarters. Some nights he
        would get really drunk, go into his office and start throwing batarangs
        at the posters cursing at them. Then more often than not he would break
        out into tears and we'd have to call Alfred to come pick him up.

        It was great catching up with Harley but time was fast approaching for
        Wonder Woman to head back to Justice League headquarters because the
        party was going to be starting soon and she had a lot of hands to shake
        and pictures to take. She was saying her goodbyes to her partner in
        sexual misbehavior, or good behavior as they often liked to call it.
        When Quinn stopped her and asked. <br />
        "Hey why don't you and I get out of here and have some real fun, I know
        you'd like to?" She proposed that Diana skip the party of the sexually
        uptight and that they have a night they wouldn't soon forgot. Wonder
        Woman was conflicted because that longing in her body was urging her to
        steal away into the night with Quinn and return to headquarters in the
        morning with a bad case of amnesia. But she also wanted to be there for
        her team, Marshan Manhunter would be so upset if he didn't get the
        chance to pin the tail on her. What was she to do?
