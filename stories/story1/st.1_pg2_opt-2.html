        Despite the tempting offer Diana decided to go spend the evening with
        her pals at Justice League headquarters. Sure they were dorky sometimes
        but she had so many fond memories with them and the world was cruel for
        all of us and even superman needed reasons to celebrate.

          One of her favorite memories is when they all had a race to see who
          could reach their favorite taco shop "Tacos Por Favor" 4 cities over.

        When she arrived at headquarters the preparations for the party were
        pretty much complete. Flyers and streamers were decorated around and
        balloons littered the floor. The caterers that superman hired were in
        position and they were prepared to serve up an assortment of delicious
        delicacies from mini quiches to smoked ham. The mayor of the city was to
        be in attendance as well as kernel Sanders so it was to be the most
        opulent of gatherings.

        The party went off without a hitch. The was singing and dancing and
        plenty of pin the tail on the wonder woman, fully clothed of course.
        People ate and drank and told old war stories and wonder woman was in
        bed by 11:30.
