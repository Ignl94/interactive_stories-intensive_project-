        Wonder Woman is relaxing at the spa after a long week of fighting evil
        with the Justice League. She is getting ready for a party the league is
        having later to celebrate the successful destruction of Brainiac's
        doomsday device. She has been at the spa since the morning and it is now
        mid afternoon. She's gotten a pedicure and a manicure, sat in the
        mudbath, soaked in the jacuzzi, and took a 20 minute nap. Now Franchesca
        is giving her the best facial and massage combination of her life.

          She lay there thinking about the events that were to take place in the
          evening. Marshan Manhunter was so excited to play pin the tail on the
          donkey and Batman was getting the stage set up for karaoke. Everyone
          else was out gathering supplies and make sure all guests would be
          accounted for. Wonder Woman loved her team and she loved her job but
          for a bunch of adults they sure threw some lame parties. Honestly she
          would have preferred to ditch the whole thing. What she needed was
          some release, something she really enjoyed and found exciting.
          Something she hadn't done in a while.

          It was about 5:00 pm when Wonder Woman left the spa. She was feeling a
          bit peckish and decided to stop by a coffee shop for a bite to eat.
          She ordered a warm pastry with an even warmer coffee to wash it down.
          As she sat there enjoying her treat a familiar face walked up to greet
          her.

            It feels like forever since i've seen you Diana. How long has it
            been, like two years now right? We used to have so much fun together
            when we weren't busy taking care of men's business. Don't you miss
            our fun adventures?

          Wonder Woman couldn't lie. She was really happy to see her friend.
          Despite what some might think her and Quinn had a pretty good
          relationship. Sure some would argue that they were on different sides
          of the coin when it came to the ideology of justice and lawlessness
          but they shared a very deep bond. This was simply the nature of the
          game that they played. But they were both guilty of the crime of
          passion.

        />
        <p>
          Like a flood it all came back to her, all the fun they used to have
          together. Sure Diana was an independent woman and she had been
          exploring herself long before Harley came into the seen but Quinn was
          the only person she had met in such a long time that could match her
          boldness and desire.
