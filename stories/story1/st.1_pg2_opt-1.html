        Diana's inner jiminy cricket told her to ditch her compatriots for a
        little while and spend time with Quinn in the night of Gotham City. She
        was really excited actually and despite the rough housing she expected
        them to get into she predicted no serious casualties.

        Harley decided to give the Joker a call just to let him know she'd be
        out with WW herself. Also he might get high and think she's in trouble
        next things you know the city is filled with his cronies checking strip
        clubs, local bars, and residential homes for Quinn. So she gave him a
        call and the Joker was relaxing in his private lounge with a group of
        girls he met on Tinder. "Hey Puddin, i'm going out with Diana again, see
        yah!", said Quinn as she hung up the phone shortly after.

          The Joker wasn't sure what to say, he remembered what happened the
          last time those two 'went out' together. They destroyed 1/3 of the
          city in four hours. The Mayor got mad, Batman got mad, Jesus got mad.
          The Joker had to kick her out to discipline her but that made her mad
          so she made a suicide squad and destroyed more of the city. And where
          was Diana... well apparently she forgot the whole thing and was back
          on Justice League business.

        All in all the Joker was just happy the Harley wasn't going to be tying
        him up tonight! She was always so rough and the women with him tonight
        would be perfect angels by comparison.
